# Bridging Kernel Drivers and Virtual Device Models with LLM-Powered Automation

## Driver Information Collection

In the first phase of **DevGen**, the core source code of the target kernel will be extracted, and the main execution will be carried out in the `static_analyze` directory.

## LLM-Guided Device Modeling

The core stage of **DevGen** mainly involves using LLM to guide the generation of virtual device code. The specific details can be found in the `DevGen_Core` directory.

## Repair Case Library Construction
We identified common errors and established a case library to assist LLMs in making corrections, with 9 categories and 15 repair cases in the `Case_Repair_Library` directory.

## Integration and Fuzzing

1. Simplify the static analysis part of the code and generate a JSON file,run `python3 generate_json.py`
2. Process the target driver code based on the generated JSON file.`python3 simple_code.py`
3. Modify the relevant path names and perform the fuzzing.`start_fuzz.py`

## Config and Result

1. We have placed all the configurations that **DevGen** needs during its execution in the `config` directory.
2. The `result` directory contains the results of different model simulations as well as coverage and crash information.
